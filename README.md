# NoSQL Social Network API

## Description

With this program, you can create users, thoughts, and reactions. Users have thoughts, and thoughts have reactions. Add, view, update, or remove your thoughts, reaction text, email, and username using GET, PUT, POST, and DELETE routes.

## Usage

In the terminal, type "npm run seed" to seed the program. Then, type "npm run dev" and open up a client like Insomnia or Postman to use your routes. Routes are /api/users and /api/thoughts
